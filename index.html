            <p>As I reflect on my journey through the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University, I am filled with a deep sense of accomplishment and purpose. Since beginning the program in June 2023, I have grown immensely—technically and professionally—gaining hands-on experience and confidence in building scalable, secure, and maintainable applications. Developing this ePortfolio has allowed me to showcase not just my final capstone project but the culmination of key learning milestones that now define my competence as a computer scientist.</p>
        <p>Throughout this program, I acquired critical skills in programming with Java, C++, and Python, alongside strong foundations in databases, web development, and cybersecurity. Among the most impactful learning experiences were:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Building and debugging full-stack applications using SQL databases and Java.</li>
            <li>Designing secure login and inventory management features that follow authentication best practices.</li>
            <li>Leveraging data structures and algorithms to enhance performance and user experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My capstone project—a mobile inventory management system originally developed in CS-360 and enhanced for this portfolio—was a true demonstration of applying these competencies in real-world scenarios. I extended the application’s features with Firebase for cloud storage and real-time synchronization, optimized search and sorting operations with algorithmic improvements, and emphasized secure coding principles. These enhancements reflect not only my technical growth but also my alignment with industry standards and best practices.</p>
        <p>Beyond technical implementation, the program emphasized the importance of professional collaboration and communication. I had several opportunities to work in team environments, whether peer-reviewing code, discussing algorithm design, or building out collaborative project databases. This helped me refine my ability to communicate technical ideas effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. For instance, while working on the QuantigrationUpdates database project in DAD-220, I wrote documentation and developed queries that could be easily interpreted and extended by others—skills crucial in real-world software teams.</p>
        <p>Security has become a central part of how I think about software. Courses like CS-405: Secure Coding and IT-380: Cybersecurity and Information Assurance helped me develop a “security-first” mindset. This was reflected in the capstone project by implementing secure user authentication, input validation, and future-proofing against SQL injection vulnerabilities. I now naturally approach design choices with an understanding of both the functional and security implications.</p>
        <p>In terms of software engineering and databases, my growth is evident in how I’ve transitioned from building local applications to designing cloud-integrated systems. I learned how to weigh trade-offs, such as choosing Firebase over SQLite for scalability and multi-user support. My ability to write clean, reusable code and apply the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture has improved the maintainability and usability of my projects.</p>
        <p>The artifacts in my ePortfolio collectively tell the story of a developer who is not only capable of writing functional code but who values optimization, user experience, scalability, and security. The CS-360 Inventory App highlights my skills in mobile development and software architecture. The DAD-220 QuantigrationUpdates Database Project showcases my database design and SQL query expertise. Both artifacts, and the enhancements added to them, serve as concrete proof of my readiness to enter the field.</p>
        <p>In summary, my ePortfolio is more than a showcase of coursework; it is a professional representation of my growth, strengths, and readiness to contribute to the tech industry. I am now prepared to pursue a career in full-stack development with a focus on backend systems and cybersecurity. My experience, technical foundation, and problem-solving mindset equip me to thrive in team-based environments, deliver secure and scalable solutions, and continuously learn and adapt in a rapidly evolving field.</p>

            <h2>My Journey in Computer Science</h2>
            <p>Throughout my studies, I have worked on various projects including ones in OpenGL throughout my CS 330- Computer Graphics and Visualization course, learning to create shapes, apply textures, and incorporate lighting effects. Below are some snapshots of my progress:</p>
